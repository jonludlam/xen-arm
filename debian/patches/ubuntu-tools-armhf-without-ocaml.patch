Subject: tools: Disable ocaml build on armhf

Problem right now is that the ocaml library seems to have hard
dependencies on some cpuid related functions which only exist
on x86.
Until that is sorted out upstream (apparently when they build
for Arm they have had no ocaml package installed), prevent
the build. This also needs some modifications in debian/rules.real
but those won't show up in the patch.
